# Requirements
## Introduction
 --- The code implemented, has considered the basic requirement of reading and writing data with user friendly environment.

## Defining Our System
    -- The designed code is used to read and  write data. An excel sheet has been made manually which consists of 5 sheets and 1 master sheet. Here we are searching details of an individual corresponding to a particular name and registration number in all the 5 sub-sheets. Once the data has been fetched from the sub sheets then it will be printed to the master sheet. The whole implementation is used to read a file for better searching and writing.  The code makes the study easier in the field of data science where lots and lots of data needs extraction.
