# PYTHON MINI PROJECT
The main objective of the designed code is to read and write data. The code implemented, has considered the basic requirement of reading and writing data with user friendly environment. 
An excel sheet has been made manually which consists of 5 sheets, 1 master sheet and 1 summary sheet. Here we are searching details of an individual in all the 5 sub-sheets corresponding to : 

Name: 
Registration number:
Email ID: 

Once the data has been fetched from the sub sheets then it will be printed to the master sheet. The excel sheet also consists of a summary sheet which indicates the count number of data fetched from each sheet. The whole implementation is used to read a file for better searching and writing. The code makes the study easier in the field of data science where lots and lots of data needs extraction.


#1. The program is a python file which is in present at:

        **implementation --> src --> project.py**

**#2. Run the code i.e .py file onto a python IDE like pycharm.**

**#3. After running the program, enter the necessary details which will be asked like Registration No./PS No., Name, and email ID:**

**#4. Press Enter.**

**#5. A message will be diplayed on the terminal window, indicating that the data has been written on the mastersheet.**

**#6. Open the Datasheet excel file. And you can see the data printed onto the mastersheet.**


**#6. After mastersheet, summary data will be printed to the summary sheet as well, indicating the number of data fetched from every sheet.**

## Challenges Faced and How was it overcome 
* Initially hard coded was implemented but soft coded
* Excelsheet was not linked initially with thepython file.
* Multiple entry was not there initially
* Summary Sheet was not understandable initially but later understood after discussion with faculty
